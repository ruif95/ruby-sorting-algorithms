# Ruby - Sorting Algorithms

## Execution

To run tests:
```bash
rspec
```

To run test execution task:
```bash
bundle exec rake
```

## Description

This repository serves two purposes:
- Get familiar with Ruby;
- Practice Sorting algorithms.

### Algos

The idea is to *at least* implement:
- Heap Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

### Ruby Structure

The idea is to implement a generic Ruby repo structure, with `lib/` for code, `spec/` for RSpec tests, and other generic ruby files, as well as creating a generic CI workflow to execute the tests through Rake.
